# Cloud Build Notifiers

This repo provides deployable notifier images and sources, as well as libraries
for creating new notifiers.

> This is an Alpha release of Cloud Build Notifiers.

> We do not recommend using this codebase for production applications.
> Furthermore, this release is not subject to any SLA or deprecation policy.

[Cloud Build](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build) notifiers are Docker
containers that connect to the
[Cloud Build Pub/Sub topic](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/send-build-notifications)
that adapt Pub/Sub messages about Build update notifications to other
services/protocols, such as SMTP for email.
Cloud Build notifiers are long-lived binaries that receive notifications throughout
Builds' lifecycles (e.g. from the Build starting to execute through the Build finishing).

All notifiers can be built by Cloud Build and deployed on
[Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run). The only prerequisite is to be a
Cloud Build user and to have the
[gcloud CLI tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/) installed and configured
for your Cloud Build project(s).

There are currently 3 supported notifier types:

-   [`smtp`](./smtp/README.md), which sends emails via an SMTP server.
-   [`http`](./http/README.md), which sends (HTTP `POST`s) a JSON payload to
    another HTTP endpoint.
-   [`slack`](./slack/README.md), which uses a Slack webhook to post a message
    in a Slack channel.

**See the [Google Cloud Alpha docs](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configure-notifications) for how to use Cloud Build Notifiers.**

**Note: Docs are only available to Cloud Build Alpha users.**

A setup script exists that should automate _most_ of the notifier setup.

Run `./setup.sh --help` for usage instructions.
